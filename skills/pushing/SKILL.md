# reharm:pushing — Next-Step Advisor (read-only)

The anticipation beat — like *pushing* a note ahead of the bar, this looks at where a scope stands and calls the next move before you have to ask: seed (`root`), evolve (`reharmonization`), resolve ambiguity (`critique`), or borrow across scopes (`modal-interchange`).

**This is the only read-only skill: it inspects and recommends, never writes a file, never runs another skill.** That preserves the protocol's contract — nothing is auto-decided; you pick the targets and adjudicate (EVOLUTION.md §3, §4 Phase B). **Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../EVOLUTION.md`** for the state definitions it reads: §3 (maturity + re-verification cadence), §7 (session evaluation + stagnation).

## Procedure

1. **Resolve the scope** (`.raw/` + `wiki/` present). If the cwd is not a scope, take the path from arguments or ask once. If no scope exists at all → recommend `reharm:root` and stop.
2. **Gather state** — every signal already exists (§8); all reads, no writes:
   - **Frontier**: `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/boundary-score.py" --json --top 5` from the scope root. Positive-`score` pages are evolution-ready (outward-pointing, recently touched).
   - **Health**: `python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/wiki-lint.py" --json` from the scope root. Read `clean` and `counts` (`contradictions`, `orphans`, `dead_wikilinks`, `missing_frontmatter`, `duplicate_stems`).
   - **Census**: `status_census` in the lint JSON above — the **computed** node totals per status (claims + mashups). The `**Census:**` line in `wiki/index.md` is display-only; a `census_drift` warning in the same JSON means the display line needs a refresh, never that the census signal is wrong.
   - **Last session**: the newest `wiki/meta/evolution/E####.eval.json` — `pass` and `stagnation.verdict` (`continue` / `reseed` / `change-strategy`).
   - **Decay**: node frontmatter `last_challenged` vs the §3 cadence (seed/developing every session, hardened 4 weeks, evergreen 12 weeks). Scopes are small — read dates directly, no script.
   - **Unprocessed material**: `.raw/` files (recursively) with no matching `wiki/sources/` page.
   - **Stuck at the evergreen gate**: `status: hardened` nodes whose `## Field Evidence` is empty (filter by frontmatter status, then read just those bodies). Only the §2 code workspace can produce the real-world result they need.
   - **Sibling scopes**: count sibling directories that are also scopes (for the modal-interchange signal).
3. **Apply the cascade** — first match wins; surface lower matches as secondary candidates so the user sees the whole board:

   | # | Condition | Recommend |
   |---|---|---|
   | 1 | no scope / 0 evolving nodes | `root` — seed first |
   | 2 | `.raw/` material not yet atomized | `root` — atomize new material before evolving |
   | 3 | lint `clean:false` (contradictions, dead links, orphans, missing frontmatter) **or** `questions/` backlog **or** low-confidence nodes stalled ≥2 sessions | `critique` — clear structural/ambiguity debt before evolving |
   | 4 | positive-score frontier, **or** nodes past their §3 cadence, **or** last `eval.json` `pass:false` | `reharmonization` — Phase A resumes any failing checks |
   | 5 | `status: hardened` node(s) with empty `## Field Evidence` (stuck at the evergreen gate) | **design the experiment** — `reharm:experiment-design` pre-registers it (hypothesis + a CONFIRM/REFUTE criterion fixed before the run, §12); the runner then executes it in the §2 code workspace and the report lands in `.raw/experiments-results/` to evolve (field evidence is the only evergreen gate, §3). If a `planned`/`running` `type: experiment` node already exists for the claim, point at its handoff instead of re-designing. Read-only: a recommendation, not an action |
   | 6 | stagnation `verdict:"reseed"` (flat scores, no new seeds) | `root` — needs new raw material, not more churn |
   | 7 | stagnation `verdict:"change-strategy"` | `critique` — rethink targets, not the same loop |
   | 8 | ≥2 scopes and nothing above fired | `modal-interchange` — optional cross-scope mashup |
   | 9 | nothing pending | report **current**; show the soonest next re-verification date |

4. **Report** in the user's language: the recommended skill, the **evidence** (the specific counts / candidate pages / verdict that triggered it), the exact command to run next, and any secondary candidates. Then stop — the user runs the chosen skill.

## Constraints

- **Read-only. Writes no file, edits no node, runs no other skill, touches no git state.** It is a recommendation, not an action — the user always chooses (EVOLUTION.md "nothing is auto-decided").
- **One scope per run** (mirrors reharmonization). Cross-scope comparison is `modal-interchange`'s job; pushing only *suggests* it when ≥2 scopes exist.
- **No new state file** — it derives everything from the two stdlib scripts plus `index.md` / `E####.eval.json` / frontmatter. If `wiki/` is missing, say so and recommend `root`.
- If two branches tie, present both and let the user pick — do not force a single answer.
